In this project, I have created an infrastructure using which I can launch three containers all at a time. The first container is a webserver which is created using Nginx, the second one is a database server, which is created using MYSQL, and the third one is a PHP server. All the three containers are linked with each other.

The main aim of the project is to launch a webpage using a webserver (here, Nginx) that is linked with a PHP as well a MYSQL server. The webpage will show a world map that marks almost all the countries in this world including their name. The web page is created using the FOLIUM library of python and then, it has been deployed in the webserver. 

What is Nginx?
NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

What is MYQSL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses.

What is PHP?
PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor (no, the acronym doesn't follow the name). It's an open source, server-side, scripting language used for the development of web applications. By scripting language, we mean a program that is script-based (lines of code) written for the automation of tasks.
